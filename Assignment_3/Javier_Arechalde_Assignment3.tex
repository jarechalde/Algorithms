\section*{1. Time-series data mining}

\subsection*{1.1 Problem description}

In this problem we will have a sequence of events, and we want to find out if this sequence of events is a subsequence of other longer sequence, but the events dont necessarily need to be consecutive.

For example, we will have a sequence of events as follows:

\begin{center}
\texttt{buy Yahoo, buy eBay, buy Yahoo, buy Oracle}
\end{center}

And another longer sequence, which may or may not contain the subsequence of events shown above.

\begin{center}
\texttt{buy Amazon, buy Yahoo, buy eBay, buy Yahoo, buy Yahoo, buy Oracle}
\end{center}

The goal is to quickly detect if $S'$ is a subsequence of $S$.

Then we will formulate this problem this way:

Given two sequence of events, $S'$ of length $m$ and $S$ of length $n$ each containing an event possibly more than once, we want to find in time $O(m+n)$ if $S'$ is a subsequence of $S$.

\subsection*{1.2 Proposed solution}

In our implementation, we will iterate over the two arrays, to find if $S'$ is a subsequence of $S$.

We will start by taking the first element in $S'$, then we will start checking if we can find that element in $S$. If we find that element in $S$, we move to the next element in $S'$, and start seaching for the second element in $S$, starting from the $S$ position right after we found the first element of $S'$. If we can't find that element in $S$, that means we reached the final position in $S$ without finding that element, we will return that $S'$ is not a subset of $S$. If we find all the elements of $S'$ in $S$, we will return that $S'$ is a subset of $S$.

\subsection*{1.3 Pseudo code}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Checking if $S'$ subset of $S$}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State We initialize $i_{pos} = j_{pos} = 0$
\While {We didnt reach the end of $S$ or $S'$}
 \State Take $S(i_{pos})$
 \For {$j$ in range $j_{pos} \to length(S)$}
  \If{$S'(i_{pos}) == S(j_{pos})$}
   \If{$i_{pos} == length(S')$}
    \State $S'$ is a subsequence of $S$
   \EndIf
   \If{$i_{pos} \neq length(S')$}
    \State $i_{pos}++$
    \State $j_{pos} = j$
    \State Break the loop
   \EndIf
  \EndIf
  \If{$S'(i_{pos}) \neq S(j_{pos})$}
   \State $j++$
  \EndIf
 \EndFor
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection*{1.4 Example}

Here we should prove that our algorithm is correct too.

\section*{1.5 Time complexity}

In worst case scenario, the last element of $S'$ will be in the last position of $S$, therefore, we would have iterated over both lists to check if $S'$ is a subset of $S$. As the length of $S'$ is $m$ and the length of $S$ is $n$, the time complexity of our implementation will be $O(m+n)$.
