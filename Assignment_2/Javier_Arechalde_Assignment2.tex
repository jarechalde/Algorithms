\section*{Stress Testing}

\subsection*{Model description}

In this problem, we are stress-testing different models of glass jars, to determine the highes distance they can be dropped without breaking.

For the test setup we have a ladder with $n$ rungs, and as we stated before, we want to find the \textit{highest safe rung}, that is the maximum distance we can drop a jar from, without it breaking. For this test, we have $k$ jars available, this number of jars, will change depending, on the requirements of each type of test.

\subsection*{a.}

In this case our budget is limited to $k = 2$ and we want to find a solution $f(n)$ that grows slower than linearly. The breaking distance for the first jar $k_1$ is $bd$ and the breaking distance for the second jar $k_2$ is $bd$ too, as they are two models of the same jar.

The current rung we are dropping our jars from is $r$, and the highest safe run will be assigned to $sr$.

\subsection*{Overall idea}

In case we are given 2 jars, $k = 2$, we will use one algorithm with a different approach from linear or binary, because if we use linear search, our solution will grow linearly, but if we use binary search, we will exceed the number of available jars we have for this problem.

For running this test, we will divide the set of $n$ rungs into $m$ parts, each one of these parts containing $n/m$ parts.

First we will use the first jar iterating over the $m$ parts until the jar breaks, by steps of size $n/m$. Once the first jar breaks, we will then start from the previous rung (distanced $n/m$ from the rung on which the jar broke) with the next jar, increasing the rungs by $1$, then the maximum safe rung will be the previous rung on which the second jar broke.
 
\subsection*{Pseudocode}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{My implementation}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State At the beginning $r = 0$ and $k_1,k_2$ are not broken
\State We have $n$ rungs, and we chose to separate our rungs into $m$ divisions
\While{$k_1$ not broken}
 \State Start increasing distance in steps of $n/m$
 \State Saving last ring $r_0 = r$
 \State $r = r + n/m$
 \If{$r>bd$}
  \State $k_1$ breaks at rung r
 \EndIf
\EndWhile
\State We start our next iterations from r = r0
\While{$k_2$ not broken}
 \State r = r + 1
 \If{$r>bd$}
  \State $k_2$ breaks at rung $r$
  \State We return $sr = r-1$, safest rung distance for the jars not to break
 \EndIf 
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection*{Example}

In this section, we will show our implementation, and we will run it over a sample set.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{Problem1a.py}

In the image shown below, you can see the results of running this algorithm over the sample set.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Time complexity analysis}

As we stated before, in our solution, we will divide the ladder into $m$ divisions. This way, our algorithm will take $(m+n/m)$ steps at most, so then the time complexity of our implementation will be $O(m+n/m)$. This can be explained because in the worst case scenario, we will need to go over all the $m$ divisions to find the rung on which the first jar breaks, and then go to the start of the previous division before it broke, then iterate towards next division, on steps of $1$, which is $n/m$ steps away, at most, from the next division.

\subsection*{b.}

In this case, out budget is limited to $k$ jars, where $k>2$. We want to find the highest safe rung using at most $k$ jars. For each jar $k_i$ the number of times we drop whis jar should be reduced exponentially compared to the number of times we dropped the previous jar $k_{i-1}$ so $\lim_{n\to\infty} f_k(n)/f_{k-1}(n) = 0$.

The current rung we are dropping our jars from is $r$, and the highest safe run will be assigned to $sr$.

\subsection*{Overall idea}

In case we have $k$ jars to run our test, we will try this approach. One of the requirements for the solution is that the number of times we had to drop the jar exponientally decreases with each iteration. To fulfill this requirement, we decided to divide the jars into $n^{1/(k+1)}$ divisions, at each step, being $n$ the distance we are working with, being the whole rung distance at the beginning of our algorithm, and decreasing to the space between the point the jar broke, and the previous rung, with was a step size away from that rung. This way, at each iteration of our algorithm, the number of divisions we divide our rungs in will exponentially decrease at each step.

\subsection*{Pseudocode}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{My implementation}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{Test}{start,end,k,jar}
 \State{Divide the rungs into $n^(1/k+1)$ divisions}
 \State {Find the step size $step = (start-end)/(number of divisions)$}
 \While{Jar didnt break}
  \State Increase drop distance by the step size $step$
  \If {Drop distance is greater than the breaking point}
   \State Jar k  breaks
   \State Report highest safe rung, which would be $sr = r - step$
   \If{We still have jars available}

    \Call{Test}{k+1,previousrung,rungbroke}
   \EndIf
  \EndIf
 \EndWhile
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection*{Example}

To prove that our algorithm works, we implemented it in Python, and we ran it over a sample dataset.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{problem1b.py}

Here are the results we obtained by running the algorithm over the sample dataset.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.8]{problem1b}
\end{center}
\caption{Results}
\end{figure}

An important thing to note in this implementation, is that due to the nature of the algorithm, we may not be able to find the highest safe run, because our algorithm will skip it due to the step size. If we don't find a solution for this, we wont find the actual highest safe rung, but an approximation of it instead. My solution for this issue was to fix the step size when the number of divisions won't go lower than $1$. This way, even though we are not fullfilling the requierement set in the problem for the last step, we will be able to fing the actual highest safe rung rather than an approximation.

\subsection*{Time complexity analysis}

For this problem, we recursively reduced the number of rungs we have to check to find the highest safe rung, then the run for this implementation will be $n^{1/2}+n^{1/3}+...+n^{1/(k+1)}$ so the complexity in big-$O$ notation will be given by $O(n^{1/2})$.

\section*{Butterfly Studies}

\subsection*{Model description}

In this problem, we have $n$ butterflies, and we want to separate then in two groups. Let's call this groups $A$ and $B$. It doesn't matter in which group we classify each one of the butterflies, because we only want to separate them in two groups, we don't need to put them in an specific group.

To complete this task, we are given a $m$ comparisons that dictaminate if the pair of specimens $i,j$ belong to the same group, or they are in two separate groups. This number of $m$ comparisons, is smaller than the possible number of pairs in the set of specimens, which is $n(n-1)/2$, because some pairs are ambiguous, which means that we are not sure if the pair belongs to the same group or not.

We want to determine if this set of $m$ comparisons is consistant, and thus, we are separating the butterflies coherently.

\subsection*{Overall idea}

We will have a dictionary containing the $n$ different specimens that we want to separate. This way, we can check in only $O(1)$, the group each specimen its assigned.

We will have a set of $m$ tuples that dictaminates if both specimens are in 'S' (Same group) or 'D' (different group). We also assume that this set of tuples comes in order, starting first with the pairs that contain specimen 1, then the pairs that contain specimen 2, etc. Otherwise, we should order the pairs first.

We will start going tuple by tuple, if none of them have a group assigned, we will assign them to the same group, or to a different group, depending the notation on that tuple. If only one member of the tuple has a group assigned, we will assign the other tuple to the same group or the different one, according to the notation on that tuple. In the end, if both tuples have a group already assigned, we will proceed to check if this new notation is consistent or not. In the case it's not consistent, the whole classification is unconsistent, and we stop our algorihtm.

\subsection*{Pseudocode}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{My Implementation}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\While{The pairs are consistent, for every tuple in $m$}
 \State Take one tuple $m_i \in m$
 \If{None of the tuple members have a group assigned}
  \If{Tuple in the same group}
   \State Assign group $A$ to $m_i[0]$
   \State Assign group $A$ to $m_i[1]$
  \ElsIf{Tuple in different group}
   \State Assign group $A$ to $m_i[0]$.
   \State Assign group $B$ to $m_i[1]$.
  \EndIf
 \EndIf
 \If{One of the members in the tuple has a group assigned}[[
  \If{Tuple in the same group}
   \State Assign $Group(m_i[0])$ to $m_i[1]$
  \ElsIf{Tuple in different group}
   \State Assign opposite $Group(m_i[0])$ to $m_i[1]$
  \EndIf
 \EndIf
 \If{Both members on the tuple have a group assigned already}
  \If{Tuple in the same group}
   \If{They have different groups assigned}
    \State Inconsistency!
   \Else
    \State continue
   \EndIf
  \ElsIf{Tuple in different group}
   \If{They have same groups assigned}
    \State Inconsistency!
   \Else
    \State continue
   \EndIf
  \EndIf
 \EndIf
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection*{Example}

To prove that our algorithm works, we implemented it in Python, and we ran it over a sample dataset.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{problem2.py}

Here are the results we obtained by running the algorithm over the sample dataset.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.8]{problem2}
\end{center}
\caption{Results}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Time complexity analysis}

Our algorithm will run over all the tuples, this takes $O(m)$ time, because $m$ is the number of tuples in our dataset. Then, our algorithm will have to check at most, the $n$ specimens, to assign this specimens a group, this would take $O(n)$ time. So our algorithm time complexity will be $O(m+n)$ then.
